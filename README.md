A Julia library for **_Ten_**sor **_Net_**works. `Tenet` can be executed both at local environments and on large supercomputers. Its goals are,

- **Expressibility** _Simple to use._ üë∂
- **Flexibility** _Extend it to your needs._ üîß
- **Performance** _Goes brr... fast._ üèéÔ∏è

`Tenet` can be executed both at local environments and on large supercomputers.
