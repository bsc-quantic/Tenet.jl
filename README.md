A Julia library for **Ten**sor **Net**works. `Tenet` can be executed both at local environments and on large supercomputers. Its goals are,

- **Expressiveness** _Simple to use._ üë∂
- **Flexibility** _Extend it to your needs._ üîß
- **Performance** _Goes brr... fast._ üèéÔ∏è

A video of its presentation at JuliaCon 2023 can be seen here:
