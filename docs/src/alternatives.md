# Alternatives

`Tenet` is strongly opinionated. We acknowledge that it may not suit all cases (although we try ðŸ™‚). If your case doesn't fit `Tenet`'s design, you can try the following libraries:

- [quimb](https://github.com/jcmgray/quimb) Flexible Tensor Network written in Python. Main source of inspiration for `Tenet`.
- [tenpy](https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy) Tensor Network library written in Python with a strong focus on physics.
- [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl) and [ITensorNetworks.jl](https://github.com/ITensors/ITensorNetworks.jl) Mature Tensor Network framework written in Julia.
- [tensorkrowch](https://github.com/joserapa98/tensorkrowch) A new Tensor Network library built on top of PyTorch.
- [SeeMPS](https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/seemps)
