# Alternatives

`Tenet` is strongly opinionated. We acknowledge that it may not suit all cases (although we try ðŸ™‚). If your case doesn't fit `Tenet`'s design, you can try the following libraries:

- [quimb](https://github.com/jcmgray/quimb) [gray2018quimb](@cite) Flexible Tensor Network written in Python. Main source of inspiration for `Tenet`.
- [tenpy](https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy) [hauschild2021tensor](@cite) Tensor Network library written in Python with a strong focus on physics.
- [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl) [itensor](@cite) Mature Tensor Network framework written in Julia.
- [tensorkrowch](https://github.com/joserapa98/tensorkrowch) [ramon2023tensorkrowch](@cite) A new Tensor Network library built on top of PyTorch.
