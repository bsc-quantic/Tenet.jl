# Tensor

A tensor $T$ of order[^1] $n$ is a multilinear[^2] application between $n$ vector spaces over a field $\mathcal{F}$.

[^1]: The _order_ of a tensor may also be known as _rank_ or _dimensionality_ in other fields. However, these can be missleading, since it has nothing to do with the _rank_ of linear algebra nor with the _dimensionality_ of a vector space. We prefer to use _order_.
[^2]: Meaning that the relationships between the output and the inputs, and the inputs between them, are linear.

```math
T(\mathbf{v}^{(1)}, \dots, \mathbf{v}^{(n)}) = c \in \mathcal{F} \qquad\qquad \forall i, \mathbf{v}^{(i)} \in \mathcal{F}^{\dim(i)}
```

It is a higher-dimensional generalization of linear algebra, where scalar numbers can be viewed as _order-0 tensors_, vectors as _order-1 tensors_, matrices as _order-2 tensors_, ...

Letters are used to identify each of the vector spaces the tensor relates to.
In computer science, you would intuitively think of tensors as "_n-dimensional arrays with named dimensions_".

```math
T_{ijk}
```

You can create a `Tensor` by passing an array and a list of `Symbol`s that name indices.

```@example tensor
using Tenet # hide
T = Tensor(rand(5,3,2), (:i,:j,:k))
```

The _dimensionality_ or size of each index can be consulted using the `size` function.

```

```@repl tensor
size(T)
size(T, :j)
length(T)
```

## Metadata

`Tensor`s may contain some metadata.
