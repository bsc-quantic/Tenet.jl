# Tenet.jl

!!! info "BSC-Quantic's Registry"
    `Tenet` and some of its dependencies are located in our [own Julia registry](https://github.com/bsc-quantic/Registry).
    In order to download `Tenet`, add our registry to your Julia installation by using the [Pkg mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) in a REPL session,

    ```julia
    using Pkg
    pkg"registry add https://github.com/bsc-quantic/Registry"
    ```

A Julia library for **_Ten_**sor **_Net_**works. `Tenet` can be executed both at local environments and on large supercomputers. Its goals are,

- **Expressiveness** _Simple to use_ üë∂
- **Flexibility** _Extend it to your needs_ üîß
- **Performance** _Goes brr... fast_ üèéÔ∏è

A video of its presentation at JuliaCon 2023 can be seen here:
