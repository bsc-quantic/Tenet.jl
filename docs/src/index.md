Tenet.jl is a Tensor Network library written in Julia and designed to be performant, hackable and intuitive.

!!! info "BSC-Quantic's Registry"
    `Tenet` and some of its dependencies are located in our [own Julia registry](https://github.com/bsc-quantic/Registry).
    In order to download `Tenet`, add our registry to your Julia installation by using the [Pkg mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) in a REPL session,

    ```julia
    using Pkg
    pkg"registry add https://github.com/bsc-quantic/Registry"
    ```

## Features

- Optimized Tensor Network contraction, powered by [`EinExprs`](https://github.com/bsc-quantic/EinExprs.jl)
- Tensor Network slicing/cuttings
- Automatic Differentiation of TN contraction, powered by [`EinExprs`](https://github.com/bsc-quantic/EinExprs.jl) and [`ChainRules`](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRulesCore.jl)
- 3D visualization of large networks, powered by [`Makie`](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl)
