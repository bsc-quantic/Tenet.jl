Due to noise and decoherence, the fidelity of quantum chips decrease with the circuit depth. The complexity of contracting tensor networks grows with the circuit depth, but due to the fidelity of the physical realization being small, a very rough approximation can be used. In the case of Google, they used tensor slicing for projecting some expensive to contract indices. Since the contribution of each quantum path is guessed to be similar, each slice should contribute a similar part, and by taking the same percentage of slices as the fidelity of the quantum experiment, we obtain a result with a similar fidelity.
